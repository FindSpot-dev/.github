# FindSpot

At FindSpot, we’re reinventing student life. Universities still rely on outdated portals, scattered social media groups, and bulletin boards — leaving students disconnected, stressed, and lonely. We fix that.

## 🚀 What we do
We build a Tinder-style swipe app for campuses where students, staff, and organizations connect instantly — for events, help, buy/sell/trade, jobs, meetups, and more. Think of us as the social glue holding modern campuses together, powered by smart data and AI.

## 🔥 Why it matters
- 90% of CBS students we interviewed said they want this app.
- Even a small drop in loneliness or dropouts saves universities millions.
- The next generation expects a seamless digital campus life — and we’re it.

## 🌍 Our ambition
CBS is our flagship pilot. From there, we scale to universities across Europe and the US. Just like Facebook started in Harvard dorms, FindSpot will start in Copenhagen and grow global.

## 👊 Why join us
- Build the next big social platform, starting with campuses.
- Work with a founding team of seasoned entrepreneurs, engineers, and marketers who know how to execute.
- Early-stage = high impact, real ownership, and the thrill of shaping something students will use daily.
- We move fast, test bold ideas, and celebrate wins with our community.
